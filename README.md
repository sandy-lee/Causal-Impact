# Causal Impact 

## ðŸ’¬ About:
- This notebook contains an outline of how to use the Causal Impact library as an appoach to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series. I used this process to test how effective Wordpress plugins are for gaming Google pagespeed metrics. The approach was successful and we also used it to test the impact of content changes. I presented this approach at BrightonSEO in 2020.

## ðŸ’¾ Files in this repo are:
- **Causal_Impact_Notebook.ipynb** - the notebook file contains a full tutorial I created on how to use Causal Impact and some very commom errors to avoid. This notebook was shared online with the Brighton SEO audience and was positively received.

## âš¡ Next Steps:
- There are now outstanding tasks for this project.
